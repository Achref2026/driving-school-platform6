# Driving School Platform Test Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings from comprehensive testing of the Driving School Platform, which consists of a FastAPI backend and React frontend. The testing focused on API functionality, authentication flows, and user interface components.

## Backend API Testing

### API Health and Basic Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| /health | GET | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| /api/states | GET | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| /api/driving-schools | GET | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| /api/driving-schools (with filters) | GET | 200 | ✅ PASS |

### Authentication Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| /api/auth/register | POST | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| /api/auth/login | POST | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| /api/users/me | GET | 200 | ✅ PASS |

### User Data Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| /api/dashboard | GET | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| /api/documents | GET | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| /api/notifications | GET | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| /api/courses | GET | 403 | ❌ FAIL (Expected 200, got 403) |
| /api/enroll | POST | 200 | ✅ PASS |

### Critical Bug Testing

| Test Case | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Role change from guest to student after enrollment approval | ❌ FAIL |

## Frontend Testing

The frontend testing was limited due to issues with the browser automation tool. However, we were able to verify that the frontend server is running and serving HTML content.

### Issues Identified

1. **Browser Automation Tool Access**: The browser automation tool was unable to properly access the frontend application, showing a "Preview Unavailable" message.

2. **Frontend Dependencies**: There were some issues with frontend dependencies, particularly with `react-scripts` not being found.

## Integration Testing

Due to the issues with the frontend testing, we were unable to perform comprehensive integration testing. However, we were able to verify that the backend API is functioning correctly for most endpoints.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Role Change Bug**: The critical bug where a user's role doesn't change from "guest" to "student" after enrollment approval needs to be fixed.

2. **Fix Courses API**: The `/api/courses` endpoint returns a 403 error even for authenticated users. This needs to be investigated and fixed.

3. **Frontend Dependencies**: Ensure all frontend dependencies are properly installed and configured.

4. **CORS Configuration**: Verify that CORS is properly configured to allow frontend-backend communication.

5. **Environment Variables**: Ensure that environment variables are correctly set for both frontend and backend.

## Conclusion

The backend API is mostly functional, with a few issues that need to be addressed. The frontend could not be fully tested due to technical limitations, but the server is running and serving content. The critical bug with role changes needs to be fixed before the platform can be considered production-ready.
